# MiniHack Level Editor

This tool can be used to create simple DES files for minihack environments.


## Installation


Firstly install the [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

then run the following command to get the latest stable version of npm/node:

```
nvm install stable && nvm use stable
```

### Install node dependencies

After we have the latest stable versions of node and npm installed, we need to install the dependencies for the level editor tool. We can do this with the following command:

```
npm install
```


## Running

Finally we can start the server locally which hosts the level editor tool! 

```
npm run start
```

This will start a [local server on port 3000](localhost:3000) which you can use to access the level editor
